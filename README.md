eHealth Africa has carried out an investigation on various factors that could determine if someone has covid-19 or not. The attached data are cases of covid-19 in the town of  Hocus Pocus. You will use your machine learning and data science techniques for predictive modeling and risk analysis, particularly in the healthcare sector. 

Data Collection and Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines.
Consider using ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Training
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using the testing data with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
Use the model to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 cases based on the factors provided.- Develop a flask API, if possible add an HTML to the model
Deployment
Develop a visualization
